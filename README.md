## Matlab Codes

**mini-project.m :** Main code with the importation of the model and FBA analysis.

For the others Matlab scripts you need to run "mini_project.m" first.

**FVA_plot_macro.m :** FVA analysis for the macromolecules reactions used for the biomass reaction with and without light source.

**FVA_plot_deltas.m :** FVA analysis for all the reactions in the model with and without light source.

**figure_delta.png :** Figure from the "FVA_plot_deltas.m" script that compares the flux between light and no-light conditions.

**figure_light.png :** Figure from the "FVA_plot_macro.m" script that shows the flux variations for the metabolites used in the biomass reaction with a light source.

**figure_nolight.png :** Figure from the "FVA_plot_macro.m" script that shows the flux variations for the metabolites used in the biomass reaction without a light source.

**figure_model.png :** Figure from "mini-project.m" that recreates the Figure 2 from the initial article.
